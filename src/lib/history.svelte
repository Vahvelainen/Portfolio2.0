    <h3>Founding and leading startup named Menddie.com</h3>
    <p class='years'>2020-2021</p>
    <p>
      Could I really build something of my own if I wanted? Based on coursework, I founded a repair service platform company. We build a team, and a product and were able to rise 100Kâ‚¬ funding from Finnish angel investors. We did get a bunch of good customers but the business side wasn't that successful I decided to return to study.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I used around half of my time with the design of the platform, including a variety of methods like reviews, user testing, customer journeys, AB-testing 
      and learned a lot about building digital services and entrepreneurship that I can proudly say it was a two years well spend.

    <h3>Summer internship at Design Foundation Finland</h3>
    <p class='years'>2019</p>
    <p>
      I applied for an internship with Design Foundation to get some first-hand experience from design consulting and industrial design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer included a few pre-decided projects from clients like Valmet and Arava, executed by five summer interns. There I got a very good first touch on how to work with client projects, manage processes and deliver results.

    <h3>Carpentry jobs & Military service</h3>
    <p class='years'>2015 - 2017</p>
    <p>
      Even though I received a study place in Aalto in 2015, my obligatory military service 
      in 2016 forced me to lay back my studies for few years. I used my time in between doing 
      carpenter jobs from furniture to renovating for city of Helsinki. I mostly did small 
      orders for specific needs in schools and daycare centers where I had the freedom to plan 
      my own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the military service, I ended up in leader training in reserve officer school (RUK) 
      and onward to train the next batch of leaders. Here I found interest in the 
      fundamentals of leading people.

    <h3>Wood artisan degree</h3>
    <p class='years'>2012 - 2015</p>
    <p>
      When I was younger my interest in crafts got me to study woodworking. Besides crafts, the degree included product design basics and learning to consider efficient manufacturing. It was here that I interested in product development and decided to apply to Aalto University to study design.
