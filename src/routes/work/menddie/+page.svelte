  <p>
    Menddie is an ecommerce platform for repair services. More precisely, a marketplace for tailors and sewing services to sell repairs for clothing items, with online payment and delivery both ways from customer to service providers and back.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The platform had all the functionalities expected from an online marketplace. Customers could choose between pre-listed repair prices or as a quote for more complicated jobs. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Menddie is a startup founded originally by Leevi Vahvelainen (Me) and Henri Kämäräinen in late 2019. Leevi did the design work for the platform and the service, while Henri focussed the business side. Later additions to the developing team where Elias Ojala and Simo Naatula, both doing software development.

  <h2>Pre-priced repairs</h2>
  
  <p>The first and arguably the more important feature of the online buying experience. The very first challenge in listing repair prices was the way they need to be categorized. The solution was structured in the same way as a discussion with a tailor.</p>
  
  <ol>
      <li>What is it that you have?</li>
      <li>What&#39;s broken with it?</li>
      <li>How do you want it to be fixed?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Quoting system</h2>
    
  <p>Originally developed to gain information about what is missing from the listings. A way to ask quotes from the service providers proved to be an excellent way to order the more unique repair jobs.</p>
  
  <p>Customers would simply leave a request and in the time span of three days they would get offers to their emails with a direct link to go and purchase the offered repair.</p>

  <h2>Cart & Checkout</h2>
  <p>The customerr experience was tied together with a very sophisticated checkout process.</p>

  <h2>
    Later pivot
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    After I (Leevi) left the company, the focus shifted towards working with clothing brands in order to provide brand specific repair services.
