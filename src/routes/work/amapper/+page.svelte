  <p>
    A personal weekend project of mine. I started working with it after taking Reaktor's Elements of Ai -courses and realising I could program something like this myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    On top of the technical side, the project is an minimalistic styling experiment for an online tool. The aim of the design is to make the tool easy to approach, use, and to play with.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tool is work in progress. The next step is to ask feedback from design or other professionals who might find it usefull. From this, determine is this kind of tool usefull at all and develop it accordingly.
