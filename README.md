# Leevi's portfolio 2023

Updated version now 200% cooler for using a JS framework and 100% cheaper for hosting in Google's servers.

## Projects

Projects are sadly restricted to what I have visual evidence about and what I'm allowed to show.


## Content

I claim full rights to every piece of content and using them in any context without permission is not allowed excluding use by legal basis.

## Stack

The portfolio is written in sveltekit which is my favorite JS framework. The folder structure is a bit of an host mess for it been my personall playing ground of how to organise a repo.
